Apr 04 2025 8:30 AM ,The Spectre of Trade Wars Bursts the Copper Bubble,"Numbers Report – April 04, 2025In the latest edition of the Numbers Report, we will take a look at some of the most interesting figures put out this week in the energy and metals sectors. Each week we’ll dig into some data and provide a bit of explanation on what drives the numbers. Let’s take a look.1. OPEC+ Ambition Catches Oil Markets By Surprise- In the wake of Donald Trump’s import tariff announcements, the meeting of OPEC+ ministers was widely expected to be a roll-over of existing policies, however, under the guidance of Saudi Arabia the oil group decided to speed up its unwinding. - Largely neglecting the topic of Kazakhstan’s blatant overproduction, the topic expected to be the main talking point, OPEC+ announced that it would release 411,000 b/d of additional production in May. - That volume corresponds with output increases slated for May-July 2025, with OPEC+ citing healthy market fundamentals and a positive market outlook, adding that it could further amend the pace of its unwinding when it meets May 5. - According to the Federal Reserve, Saudi Arabia needs an oil price of $91 per barrel this year to balance its budget, suggesting that Riyadh’s decision was driven more by market share concerns.2. Not Even Gold Is Immune to Seesawing Effect of US Tariffs- For several weeks, the Trump tariff frenzy has been continuously pushing gold prices to new record highs, hitting an all-time maximum of $3,167…"
Apr 04 2025 11:15 AM ,Trump's Tariffs Trigger Biggest Oil Price Drop Since 2021,"Oil prices plunged this week as a one-two punch of sweeping U.S. import tariffs and an unexpected OPEC+ supply hike erased $10 per barrel from global benchmarks.


Friday, April 04, 2025 The combined effect of Donald Trump’s import tariffs, OPEC+’s inopportune decision to speed up the unwinding of production cuts and China’s retaliatory actions have wiped off $10 per barrel from global oil prices, with ICE Brent falling below $65 per barrel for the first time since August 2021. Seeing backwardation barely change compared to the beginning of the week, one could assume that US tariffs are the defining factor for the price change, nevertheless this week will not go down well in the history of oil markets.OPEC+ Rushes to Unwind Production Cuts. Eight OPEC+ countries that have been moving along with the gradual return of their 2.2 million b/d voluntary cuts unexpectedly agreed to expedite the unwinding of production cuts, boosting output in May by 411,000 b/d, equivalent to three monthly increases. Trump Surprise Moves Squashes Metal Arbitrage. Whilst many traders expected Donald Trump’s import tariff roll-out to impact metal markets, the non-sanctioning of metals led to shrinking spreads between US and European benchmarks, with Comex gold premia over London futures halving to just $20 per ounce.China Strikes Back with 34% Tariff Move. Reacting to President Trump’s sweeping tariffs, the Chinese Finance Ministry announced that it would impose additional tariffs of 34% on all goods produced in the US from April 10, concurrently adding seven rare earth minerals to Beijing’s export controls list.

Canada’s Trans Mountain pipeline has downgraded its outlook for 2026-2028, pushing out full utilization beyond 2028 with an expectation of 84% throughput this year, largely due to lower-than-expected spot bookings in TMX, a mere 18,500 b/d so far.Nigeria Picks Shell Executive for Top Oil Post. Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu appointed Bashir Bayo Ojulari, formerly the country manager of Shell’s (LON:SHEL) operations, as the top executive of the country’s national oil firm NNPC, just weeks before NNPC’s long-anticipated IPO.Activist Investor Buys Up BP, Shorts Shell. US activist hedge fund Elliott Management, concurrently to its reforming drive in embattled oil major BP (NYSE:BP), has built up a huge short position in BP’s competitor Shell (LON:SHEL), eq univalent to about 0.5% of Shell’s total worth.IMF Warns of Global Tariff Fallout. The International Monetary Fund warned that US import tariffs and reciprocal measures triggered by them pose a ‘significant risk’ to the health of the global economy, potentially indicating that its 3.3% global GDP growth forecast for 2025-2026 could be soon cut lower.World’s Top Miner Mulls Coal Spin-Off. Australia’s mining giant BHP (ASX:BHP) has reportedly considered spinning off its iron ore and coal divisions, similarly to its previous listing of South32 in 2015, however the company’s top management as iron ore still accounts for roughly 60% of its profits.Agricultural Staples Fall Under Trade War Pressure. China’s reciprocal tariffs on the US have triggered a collapse in Chicago wheat and soybean futures as the tariff war puts US exporters at a disadvantage to Brazil, with both commodities set for their biggest weekly drop since November 2024.Colombia Overcomes Indigenous Oil Riots. Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC), the national oil firm of Colombia, resumed operations at its Rubiales and Cano Sur oil fields, producing 140,000 b/d or 18% of the country’s total output, after a deal with Indigenous associations after weeks of riots that debilitated operations.Iraq Doesn’t Want To Give Up on Kurdistan. The Iraqi Oil Ministry has reactivated efforts to find a negotiated settlement with the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan to resume oil exports from the north of the country, previously failing to convince Erbil that $16 per barrel would be an adequate price.Kazakhstan Reports Giant Rare Earth Discovery. Kazakhstan’s Industry Ministry announced the discovery of a rare earth metal deposit with an estimated resource tally of more than 20 million tonnes in the region of Karaganda, placing it behind only China and Brazil in terms of prospective resources.European Gas Stocks Plunge to Three-Year Lows. Natural gas stocks held in EU jurisdictions entered the summer period at their lowest in three years, totalling only 388 TWh of 34% of nameplate storage capacity, aggravated by a speeding up in net withdrawals to 1.02 TWh/d in the second half of March.By Tom Kool for Oilprice.com

Apr 04 2025 6:00 PM ,Demand for Lithium Strains Water Resources,"While lithium has a starring role in the global clean energy transition thanks to its fundamental importance in batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage, the “white gold” may be as much of an environmental threat as it is a savior. Extraction processes for the metal are associated with significant negative environmental externalities and public health risks, and now scientists are questioning whether the world can spare the vast amount of fresh water lithium production consumes. Lithium production is booming around the globe as demand projections continue to rise and prices recover after a period of decline due to overproduction. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has said that that lithium demand for battery-making alone will likely increase by a factor of ten in the decade between 2020 and 2030, and a 2023 report from Popular Mechanics calculated that “an electrified economy in 2030 will likely need anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes of lithium.” This represents a massive boom in production and refining capacities worldwide. For reference, “In 2021, the world produced only 105—not 105,000—tonnes.”


As lithium production ramps up, the trade-offs associated with production are becoming harder to ignore. Lithium is generally produced by pumping salty brine out of the earth in places where lithium is naturally occurring, and allowing it to dry out in evaporation pools, leaving the lithium readily available to harvest. The whole process is effective and has relatively low overhead, but it requires a staggering amount of water – around 500,000 gallons per tonne of lithium. And, in a cruel twist of irony, often takes place in some of the driest places on earth. The so-called “Lithium Triangle” of South America lies in the Atacama Desert – the world’s highest and driest. In the Chilean portion of the Atacama, a staggering 65% of the region’s water is consumed by lithium mining activities. Making matters worse, a new study from scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) shows that the Lithium Triangle has far less freshwater available for lithium mining than previously thought – about ten times less. And these results suggest that the same miscalculation has been made in global lithium extraction operations. “Our results reveal that commonly used global hydrologic models overestimate streamflow and freshwater availability substantially, leading to inaccurate water scarcity classifications,” states the paper, published last month in the scientific journal Communications Earth & Environment. It’s not all bad news – the paper also points out that there is potential for the lithium industry to significantly reduce its water footprint. “Water is the most important resource in these systems, and it’s the part of the system that is most sensitive to change,” says David Boutt, one of the paper authors and a professor of geosciences at the UMass. “I’m optimistic that, through research and development, companies can be more water efficient, especially when driven by the market.”However, lithium extraction doesn’t only threaten to suck freshwater reserves dry, it also risks contaminating the local water resources it doesn’t consume. Lithium is not the only element left behind when the brine pools evaporate. Other toxic chemicals – such as hydrochloric acid – also abound in these briny pools thanks to the lithium refining process, and have been known to leak into local water supplies. “The release of such chemicals through leeching [sic], spills or air emissions can harm communities, ecosystems and food production,"" read a 2024 report from international environment activism group Friends of the Earth. ""Moreover, lithium extraction inevitably harms the soil and also causes air contamination."" Already, there have been prominent cases of environmental and public health emergencies of this nature, such as the poisoning of the Liqi River in Tibet in 2016. 


“Like any mining process, it is invasive, it scars the landscape, it destroys the water table and it pollutes the earth and the local wells,” said Guillermo Gonzalez, a lithium battery expert from the University of Chile, in a 2009 interview. “This isn’t a green solution – it’s not a solution at all.”By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com

Apr 02 2025 5:00 PM ,Iran Targets Dramatic Output Increase From Oil Fields Bordering Iraq,"Iran is targeting a dramatic increase in oil production from the fields it shares with neighbouring Iraq, according to the chief executive officer of its Petroleum Engineering and Development Company (PEDEC), Nasrollah Zarei. These include its enormous Azadegan oil field (split into North and South sites) that sits on the same reservoir as Iraq’s huge Majnoon site, and the massive Yadavaran oil field which occupies the same reservoir as Iraq’s Sinbad site. Other notable major shared fields – among many others -- are Azar (on the Iran side)/Badra (on the Iraq side), Naft Shahr (Iran)/Naft Khana (Iraq), Dehloran (Iran)/Abu Ghurab (Iraq), West Paydar (Iran)/Fakka (Iraq), and Arvand (Iran)/South Abu Ghurab (Iraq). This is part of a broader-based plan to bring output across all Iran’s major fields in the ultra-rich oil field cluster of West Karoun to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 480,000 bpd. Over many years of sanctions against it, Iran has established that it is impossible for international observers to determine whether oil from any of these shared fields originates in sanctioned Iran or non-sanctioned Iraq, as analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order.The planned upsurge in Iranian oil production follows a major deterioration in its economy over the past few weeks, a senior source who works closely with the European Union’s (E.U.) energy security complex exclusively told OilPrice.com last week. “The budget deficit’s spiralled out of control, inflation’s on a tear, and the currency’s going through the floor, which means the effects are being seen daily on the streets [of Iran],” he said. “The police can keep things under control there, but this sort of [economic] contraction affects the Guards’ [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, IRGC] ability to keep its foreign operations going effectively,” he added. Since the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979, the two core purposes of the IRGC have been to safeguard the Republic’s unique version of Islam at home and to spread that vision across the world. Domestically this can be done by leveraging its own military muscle and the financial power that comes from its spider’s web of business interests. These comprise major stakes in many of the biggest businesses in Iran, including those connected to the country’s huge oil and gas sector, as also detailed in my latest book. Internationally, many of the same levers can be pulled to exert Iran’s influence but this often needs to be done through military, political and economic proxies, and these require payment through very specific mediums, most notably U.S. dollars, diamonds, and/or gold. Under previous international sanctions programmes, Iran has managed to keep these networks of influence fully operational with direct or indirect financial help from its friends in Russia and more recently China. More recently, though, four factors have conspired to threaten the functioning of these organisational structures.


Related: India Hikes U.S. Crude Oil Imports by 67% in MarchThe first of these in terms of timing was the sanctioning of Russia following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. For the first few months of the war the resultant spike in global oil and gas prices meant that Moscow was doing better financially at that point than it was before it began the war. However, as Europe backed increasingly hard sanctions, this changed and reduced Russia’s ability to help the IRGC either directly or indirectly. China’s help for the country it had so assiduously courted as its potential key client state in the Middle East has also dwindled in light of its own uncertain economic recovery from Covid and threats of sanctions from the U.S. These recently included moves against the methods by which Beijing previously continued to import vast quantities of Iranian oil at deeply discounted prices under the terms of the ‘Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement’, as first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject and fully detailed in my latest book on the new global oil market order.The third reason hampering the ability of the IRGC to properly operate its proxies around the globe were direct and indirect moves by Israel and its Western sponsors in the war against three of its key proxies. These included sanctions on financial mechanisms used by both the IRGC, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis – among others -- and by attacks on Guards’ and proxies’ personnel in the field and elsewhere. And the final reason is that, having been the one instrumental in removing the U.S. unilaterally from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or ‘nuclear deal’) in May 2018, second-term U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil network to exert maximum pressure on Tehran. In addition to targeting further firms associated with Iranian oil exports, the new sanctions aggressively focus on firms, ships and individuals with connections to such trade, including those in China, India and the United Arab Emirates. Ultimately, according to Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent: “The Iranian regime remains focused on leveraging its oil revenues to fund the development of its nuclear program, to produce its deadly ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, and to support its regional terrorist proxy groups.” He added: “The United States is committed to aggressively targeting any attempt by Iran to secure funding for these malign activities.”Directly targeting China with aggressive sanctions and related measures may well do more damage to Iranian oil exports than it has previously known, although it entirely depends on how rigorously such measures are enforced on Beijing. For a long time, the true amount of Iranian oil being bought by China was enormously underestimated, as exclusively highlighted at the time by OilPrice.com. The key element that the U.S. had overlooked at the time was quite simply that any and all Iranian crude oil that went into ‘bonded storage’ was not put through China’s General Administration Customs (GAC) at all – and was not even recorded as having been ‘paid for’. Consequently, it did not appear on any GAC documentation and therefore did not officially exist as having been oil imported from Iran. In addition, the U.S. previously failed to fully keep tabs on the widespread Iranian practice of disguising the origin of its oil by doing ship-to-ship transfers to tankers flying the flag of another country. As also analysed in full in my latest book on the new global oil market order, such ship-to-ship transfers have long been commonplace in and around the waters of Malaysia (and to a lesser extent Indonesia) before the vessels then made their way to ports in China. So unashamedly proud was Iran of these and other efforts to outfox the U.S.’s sanctions on these oil exports that in December 2018 at the Doha Forum, Iran’s then-Foreign Minister, Mohammad Zarif, stated that: “If there is an art that we have perfected in Iran, [that] we can teach to others for a price, it is the art of evading sanctions.” Towards the end of 2020, Iran’s then-Petroleum Minister himself, Bijan Zangeneh, added a little detail to one such tried-and-trusted method: “What we export is not under Iran’s name. The documents are changed over and over, as well as [the] specifications.”


That said, the U.S. and E.U. have learned a lot from these past oversights according to the E.U. source. “The granularity now of the targeting being done [on Iranian oil exports] is much greater than before, and the sanctions being applied against companies, ships and people connected to it – wherever they are -- will be ramped up even more in the coming weeks,” he said. However, if these new sanctions are not intelligently and rigorously implemented, Iran has proven perfectly capable of avoiding the worst effects of such measures in the past and there is much that can be done to raise oil output from its shared fields with Iraq and more broadly from its West Karoun oil field cluster. At the moment, the rate of recovery across both sets of fields from Iran’s side is at best 4.5% However, before the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, several international oil companies presented realistic plans to Iran’s Petroleum Ministry detailing how they would increase the average rate of recovery at the West Karoun and shared fields in the first instance to at least 12.5% within one year, to 20% within two years and to 50% within five years. With over 67 billion barrels of oil in place in place across the West Karoun oil fields alone, the Petroleum Ministry says that each 1% improvement in the rate of recovery would increase recoverable reserves by 670 million barrels or some US$33 billion in revenues even with oil sold even at US$50 a barrel.By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.com

Apr 02 2025 4:00 PM ,State Control Returns to Mexican Energy Production,"Mexico’s energy sector is undergoing a dramatic transformation, which was announced on the 87th anniversary of the original oil expropriation by Lazaro Cardenas. These new ‘leyes secundarias’ will substantially alter the path set by the 2013 energy reforms that opened the industry to private and foreign investment. Former President Enrique Peña Nieto’s government promised that inviting private companies into oil, gas and electricity production would modernize infrastructure, reduce costs and boost efficiency. However, this free-market approach clashed with the nationalist vision of his successor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), who saw foreign involvement as a threat to Mexico’s sovereignty. Under current President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico is cementing AMLO’s legacy with new secondary laws that place energy firmly back in state hands. These reforms significantly strengthen Pemex and the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE) which the government hopes will reshape the industry and spark economic growth. 


The most significant shift is the return of state dominance in energy production and distribution. Pemex, the state-owned oil giant, has been granted more substantial control over joint ventures, ostensibly making it easier to partner with private firms while keeping decision-making power within the government. Meanwhile, CFE’s role in electricity generation has been reinforced, with new rules ensuring that at least 54% of Mexico’s electricity must come from the state utility, regardless of market competition. Even more controversially, electricity from private producers—including those using renewable energy—is now second in line, meaning the government prioritizes CFE’s power supply over cleaner, cheaper alternatives. These changes dismantle the competitive energy market created in 2013, ensuring the state holds the reins, no matter the cost.A key—and contentious—aspect of the reforms is the elimination of independent regulators, such as the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH). These agencies were initially set up to ensure fair competition and transparency, acting as watchdogs that could keep state and private energy players in check. Now, government ministries will absorb their responsibilities, which critics warn could increase corruption and inefficiency. The administration claims this move cuts costs and streamlines decision-making, but skeptics fear it removes critical oversight and makes energy policy more vulnerable to political interference.One of the most intriguing aspects of these reforms is their approach to renewable energy. Unlike AMLO, who largely ignored clean energy in favor of oil and gas, President Sheinbaum presents herself as an environmentalist and wants Mexico to expand its wind, solar and hydroelectric capacity. However, under these new laws, CFE—not private companies—will lead this transition. While this maintains state control, it may slow innovation and investment, as private renewable energy firms now face uncertain regulations and reduced incentives. Mexico has vast potential for green energy, but it remains unclear whether these policies will help or hinder its progress toward a sustainable future.The real question is whether these reforms will benefit Mexico in the long run. On the one hand, the government argues that restoring state control protects Mexico’s resources from foreign exploitation and ensures that profits benefit Mexican citizens. On the other, outside observers note that removing competition and transparency could lead to inefficiencies, increased costs and an unreliable energy supply. Investors are already wary, with some reconsidering their presence in Mexico due to the unpredictable regulatory environment. Whether this bold energy shift succeeds or struggles will depend on how well the government manages state-run companies, energy demand and the transition to renewables. One thing is clear: Mexico’s energy future has taken a sharp turn, and the world is watching.

Apr 02 2025 3:00 PM ,Natural Hydrogen Find Challenges Energy Assumptions,"About 20 years ago, I was interviewing a candidate for a position at a major oil and gas company. On paper, they had impressive credentials, including extensive experience with hydrogen. Naturally, I asked what I thought was a straightforward follow-up: “What are the primary sources of commercial hydrogen?” The answer I received stopped me cold: “You drill a hydrogen well.”That was a disqualifying response, and for good reason. Commercial hydrogen is not produced from hydrogen wells. The overwhelming majority comes from steam methane reforming—a process that uses natural gas as a feedstock and generates significant carbon dioxide in the process. 


Hydrogen is also highly reactive, bonding readily with other elements. It was long believed that hydrogen didn’t exist in large, accessible, free-form underground deposits. Most of it, after all, is tied up in compounds like water or hydrocarbons.But science has a way of upending assumptions. Fast forward to today, and two remarkable discoveries in France are challenging what we thought we knew about hydrogen—and potentially opening the door to a cleaner and more cost-effective energy future.France’s White Hydrogen WindfallIn May 2023, a team of scientists exploring abandoned mines in France’s Lorraine region stumbled upon something remarkable: naturally occurring hydrogen, now dubbed “white hydrogen.” Further exploration in March 2025 in the nearby Moselle area revealed additional reserves. Combined, these deposits are estimated at around 92 million tons—valued at approximately $92 billion.The significance lies not just in the volume, but in the implications. This hydrogen is naturally generated deep underground, requiring no carbon-intensive production processes. That makes it fundamentally different from gray hydrogen (produced from fossil fuels) and even green hydrogen (produced via electrolysis using renewable energy).The reason hydrogen is of significant interest as an energy source is that when it is burned, it forms water vapor as the only significant emission. Thus, hydrogen is potentially an incredibly clean energy source if it can be extracted and used without the carbon emissions typically associated with hydrogen production.Where Does White Hydrogen Come From?A recent study published in Science Advances sheds light on how this elusive resource is formed. Natural hydrogen can be generated through geological processes like serpentinization, a chemical reaction between water and iron-rich minerals in mantle rocks. Over millions of years, tectonic activity can trap and concentrate this hydrogen in underground reservoirs.Notably, the study suggests that these hydrogen reservoirs may be replenishable. In other words, white hydrogen could potentially be a renewable resource—not just a one-time discovery. That possibility has intrigued researchers and investors alike.Economic and Environmental PromiseFor France, the implications are potentially transformative. The Lorraine region, long associated with the legacy of coal and steel, could see a revival as a clean energy hub. Jobs, investment, and regional development could all follow in the wake of large-scale hydrogen development.


White hydrogen could also improve France’s energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. And from a climate standpoint, it offers a zero-carbon alternative that avoids the high costs of green hydrogen and the emissions of gray hydrogen. If scalable, it could become a bridge between current energy needs and long-term climate goals.Challenges on the HorizonOf course, the discovery is just the beginning. The technology to extract natural hydrogen efficiently and economically is still in its infancy. Unlike oil and gas, where decades of expertise and infrastructure exist, white hydrogen will require substantial investment in research and development. One of the greatest challenges for hydrogen is that its energy density is low, and that can create challenges when trying to transport it long distances.Moreover, France—like most countries—has no clear regulatory framework in place for natural hydrogen exploration and production. Questions remain about ownership rights, environmental safeguards, and how to integrate white hydrogen into existing energy markets.There’s also the question of how frequently and reliably such deposits occur. While France’s finds are substantial, it’s unclear how common similar formations are globally.A Global Ripple EffectStill, the discovery has generated excitement far beyond France. Geologists and energy companies around the world are now reevaluating rock formations once thought to be of little interest. Natural hydrogen could become the focus of exploration efforts from Africa to the Americas.If even a fraction of those efforts yield results, white hydrogen could emerge as a significant player in the global energy mix—complementing renewables, displacing fossil fuels, and helping countries meet their climate commitments.A Potential Inflection PointWhen I heard that job candidate suggest hydrogen wells as a commercial source, it seemed a laughable misunderstanding. Today, it seems almost prophetic.France’s discoveries of natural hydrogen may not yet be a game-changer—but they could be. With the right mix of innovation, investment, and policy, white hydrogen might just carve out a vital niche in the clean energy future.For now, it’s a story that bears close watching—by policymakers, scientists, and investors alike. Because sometimes, even the most improbable ideas can turn out to be true.By Robert Rapier

Apr 02 2025 2:00 PM ,China Aims to Maintain Leadership in Aluminum Sector,"Via Metal Miner 


At a time when analysts expect the global demand for aluminum to rise, a new development in China may significantly impact both aluminum market demand and the country’s internal consumption. That said, market watchers know that any announcement around metals coming out of Beijing these days also has to be looked at through the lens of the ongoing tariff war with the United States.It’s a pivotal moment for China’s aluminum industry, even as the nation’s production capacity nears its government-imposed annual limit of 45 million tons (MT). The government set that ceiling in order to address overcapacity and reduce emissions. However, it unveiled a fresh plan last week—one that spells out several “ambitious” new goals for the aluminum sector.Anything that China says or does these days where metals and minerals are concerned makes experts and markets sit up and take note. China is the largest producer and one of the biggest consumers of aluminum, producing about 43 MT annually. As a result, experts and analysts are now scurrying to make sense of the MIIT report and its potential impact on aluminum and bauxite, the latter being the primary source of alumina.China Intent on Remaining the Global Aluminum Market LeaderWhile it may be far too early to accurately predict the final outcome of this new plan, initial reactions by a handful of analysts have said that it could be a two-fold attempt by China. They theorize the plan will not only streamline the industry, but allow the country to go “all in” on a greener method of production, thus helping it retain its leadership position in the aluminum market.Only time will tell how it will pan out, but the anticipated slowdown in China’s aluminum production had the industry on edge long before the release of this report. This year, aluminum production in China will likely grow by barely 2%. Next year, some experts predict the figures could be even worse. Meanwhile, the situation remains extremely fluid, especially after the U.S. recently announced the imposition of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from all other countries, including China.Salient Features of the New PlanThe new Chinese roadmap stresses better and more eco-friendly output where aluminum is concerned, as well as an improvement of the resilience and security of the aluminum supply chain. According to reports, the blueprint also spelled out targets along the two-year timeline for boosting the robustness of the raw material supply chain, using technology to innovate the production and promoting sustainable production.The plan also includes proposals to expand processing hubs. This includes boosting energy-efficient electrolytic aluminum capacity to over 30%, increasing clean energy use to at least 30% and enhancing red mud recycling to over 15%.Technological advancements will likewise focus on breakthroughs in low-carbon smelting and precision processing, driving new growth in aluminum consumption. The goal is to establish a high-quality development framework by 2035, ensuring China remains a global aluminum market leader.


The Bauxite RaceThe reality of today’s aluminum market is that everybody, including China and the U.S., is looking around for high-quality bauxite ore. For example, China’s bauxite imports in the first nine months of 2024 were 20% higher than the previous year. This report, quoting S&P Global, said Beijing’s dependence on imported bauxite was about 57%, with most of its supply coming in from Guinea.However, disruptions in that supply chain, coupled with cutbacks by other suppliers like Australia, has left China and the rest of the world looking for other global suppliers.An article in Forbes said that in the last two years, the price of Guinea ore increased to US $75/t, a rise of about 50%. Meanwhile, Australian ore price increased 60% at $55/t. Alumina and aluminum prices have also climbed, with the former surging 140% in the past year due to supply disruptions and refinery shutdowns in Australia.Likely Impact of the New Plan The slowdown in aluminum production, the deletion of tax rebates on exports and a bevy of other factors are bound to cut down China’s export numbers in the coming weeks. This, in turn, will negatively impact aluminum prices. With the announcement of the “aluminum sector makeover” plan, production dynamics will shift as China stresses cleaner production and higher-quality ores.Under the new plan, China clearly wants to cut reliance on bauxite by boosting recycling, aiming for a 15 MT increase in recycled aluminum output. Much of the plan focuses on improving energy efficiency by investing in tech to cut energy use and lower emissions for this sector.The opinion is that it’s not merely about producing cleaner aluminum, but that China is jockeying to make aluminum more sustainable so it can maintain its global position at the top of the aluminum market.How Will the Changes Affect the U.S.?Like China, the U.S. also relies heavily on bauxite imports. Last year, import figures for crude and dried bauxite ore into the U.S. saw a slight drop, though it was higher in the fourth quarter. For its part, the United States mainly imports from countries like Jamaica and Turkey.With China’s new plan, it is important to keep an eye on U.S. aluminum imports from China, Canada and several other countries. Given the ever-changing tariff scenario, the slowing down of China’s aluminum sector, the new China plan and other factors, the U.S. may have to start looking for other sources to fill the expected import shortfall.By Sohrab Darabshaw

During weeks like this, it feels more accurate to say it’s the news which is doing the abhorring.Speculation has been, understandably, rampant as to the nature, variety, and impact of the tariffs the US President Donald Trump is expected to introduce on Wednesday, and just how they might affect everything from Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ fiscal headroom and the price of your supermarket shopping, to Tesla stocks and fears of a global recession.


Trump has already imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, with further import taxes on cars and parts arriving in the US set to come in from April 2, in a blow to the UK’s automotive industry and its £7.6bn worth of exports to the US last year.The so-called ‘Liberation Day’ package of announcements – set to be unveiled in a Rose Garden event at 9pm UK time – is expected to include reciprocal tariffs on countries levying duties on US goods, dashing hopes of the UK’s ‘special relationship’ sparing us.The Washington Post reported White House aides have drawn up plans for 20 per cent tariffs on most imported goods arriving in the States – but suggested no final decision had yet been taken, leaving question marks over specific sectors or goods facing different rates.Ultimately, we don’t know – with any ironclad certainty – exactly what Trump might do. We don’t know exactly when fresh tariffs on the UK or the wider world will take effect, although there will likely be at least some delay between announcing and implementing.We also don’t know for sure what other countries will do in response – from grinning and bearing it to retaliating with their own tariffs, or negotiating with Trump, like Canada and Mexico – and how Trump will then respond to that in return… and on and on it could go.Amid the global vacuum of information, stock markets and investors are getting jittery, with the FTSE 100 down 1.3 per cent on Monday. Economists and experts are issuing warnings, including of a hit to consumers from “the burden of higher tariffs” and a “drag on global activity”, as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Far-reaching consequences, no matter what


Myron Jobson, from Interactive Investor, stressed that even if the UK “manages to escape direct levies”, the tariffs “could have far-reaching consequences” for Brits, including impacts on mortgages, corporate investment and jobs, pensions and economic growth.Business lobby groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have warned of the “huge headache for small firms” with “extra costs” causing a “huge ripple effect”.Policy chairwoman Tina McKenzie urged the government to “consider state assistance” to SMEs as they “navigate the turmoil and help the firms bounce back as going concerns”.And pollsters at More in Common found most Brits – 59 per cent – when asked said they were very or quite worried about tariffs. Just 11 per cent said they were not worried at all.No exemption for the UKSo far, so cheery. Ministers – up to and including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer – have accepted hopes of an exemption ahead of Wednesday have faded, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves warning cabinet there will be an economic “impact”, but ongoing deal talks continue.Marco Forgione, director-general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade (CIEIT) told me yesterday that he believes the US administration hopes to see a “clear sense of impact from their tariffs”, as Trump focuses on “his America First agenda”.But he insisted there was a “clear opportunity very soon afterwards we could seal an agreement” and an “appetite in Washington for a trade agreement to be reached”. Another sliver of silver lining emerged on Tuesday morning when Professor David Miles, from the OBR, suggested to the Treasury committee that a “very limited” trade war, which the UK was not involved in, could perhaps be “very, very mildly positive” for the economy.Ultimately, Starmer’s approach – maintaining a cordial relationship with the President, pursuing an economic deal, and avoiding “knee-jerk” reaction – has been shaped by the political and economic – not to mention geopolitical – complexities of the situation. There’s little he, or we, can now do, but hold our breath.By City AM

Apr 02 2025 12:00 PM ,Germany Reconsiders Storing Gold in the United States,"For decades, the idea that Germany’s gold reserves - some of the largest in the world - might not be safe in the vaults of the New York Federal Reserve would have seemed like the stuff of conspiracy theories. But as the political landscape shifts in Washington - and questions have been raised as to what's actually in US vaults, some German lawmakers are beginning to wonder aloud: Is their gold still secure?Germany holds the second-largest hoard of gold on the planet, surpassed only by the United States itself. Roughly 37 percent of that treasure - some 1,236 metric tons, currently valued at around €113 billion - supposedly lies deep beneath the streets of Manhattan, stored with America’s central bank. For decades, the arrangement was seen as a prudent hedge, offering Germany immediate access to dollar liquidity in the event of a crisis.


Now, some in Berlin are rethinking that assumption.""Of course, the question now arises again,"" Marco Wanderwitz, an outgoing lawmaker from the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told the German tabloid Bild (owned by POLITICO parent company Axel Springer) last week. Wanderwitz has long harbored doubts about the wisdom of keeping such a significant portion of the country’s wealth abroad. In 2012, he made an unsuccessful push to personally inspect the gold, urging the Bundesbank to act more transparently - or bring the bullion home.Fellow CDU member Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament, echoed those sentiments, calling for more rigorous oversight. “Official representatives of the Bundesbank must personally count the bars and document their results,” Ferber told the outlet.These calls come at a time of deepening skepticism toward the institutions that once underpinned Germany’s postwar confidence. The recent decision to discard the so-called “debt brake,” a long-sacrosanct cap on public borrowing, signaled a willingness to rethink long-standing fiscal orthodoxy. The logic behind storing Germany’s gold in New York, once assumed to be self-evident, is now coming under similar scrutiny.Adding to the speculation is Elon Musk and DOGE, who have questioned the authenticity of stated U.S. gold holdings - recently calling for a formal audit of America’s reserves.


For the Deutsche Bundesbank, which oversees the management of Germany’s reserves, any suggestion of instability is unwelcome. The central bank has maintained a quiet and resolute stance, rebuffing insinuations of risk.“We have a trustworthy and reliable partner in the Fed in New York for the storage of our gold holdings,” Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said at a press conference in February, a line the bank reiterated when asked for comment on Friday. “It does not keep me awake at night. I have complete confidence in our colleagues at the American central bank.”Famous last words...In 2013, amid a populist outcry and growing eurozone instability, the 'completely confident' Bundesbank repatriated hundreds of tons of gold previously held in Paris - a move that was seen at the time as a symbolic reassertion of sovereignty. The bank argued that, with France and Germany sharing the euro, the strategic rationale for keeping reserves in Paris had faded.Now, more than half of Germany’s gold sits safely in Frankfurt. Thirteen percent is held in London. But it is the tranche in New York - once a monument to transatlantic trust - that is drawing the most anxious of glances.By Zerohedge.com

Mar 28 2025 10:00 AM ,Trump Is Sending Mixed Signals to Oil Markets,"Oil prices are set to post a third weekly gain on the back of Trump hindering supply from Iran and Venezuela, but his economic policies are threatening to damage demand in the long term. 


Friday, March 28th, 2025 Trump has been the single biggest oil market mover in March. On the one hand, the US President tightened Venezuela sanctions and debilitated some 20 million barrels of Iranian oil, depriving China of discounted crude and adding fuel to the oil bulls’ fire. On the other hand, the long-term impacts of tariff wars could be quite damaging for oil consumption, as the $100 billion car import tariffs could trigger retaliatory measures from Europe or Japan. Overall, crude oil is set for a third weekly gain, with ICE Brent hovering around the $73.50 per barrel mark.Trump’s Car Tariffs Stoke Growth Concerns. US President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 25% tariff on automobile imports, seeking to raise $100 billion in revenue annually, however also raising concerns that such high-impact protectionist measures would stall global economic growth.


Trump’s Pressure Disrupts Iranian Exports. At least 11 VLCC tankers carrying Iranian crude have been stranded in territorial waters of Malaysia, seeing floating storage in the area rising to 18 million barrels, indicating Chinese refiners continue to stave off purchases as they weigh the impacts of US sanctions.US Oilmen Warn Against China Shipping Tax. The American Petroleum Institute and other energy organizations have tried to dissuade the Trump Administration from slapping $1.5 million levies on Chinese-built tankers calling into US ports, saying such a move would hike freight costs for US exports.BP Goes Full Circle on Iraqi Upstream. Following months of negotiations, UK oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has received final government approval from Baghdad to begin the redevelopment of the Kirkuk fields, aiming to produce 3 billion boe through a JV that would also involve Iraq’s North Oil Company.Chinese Refiners Warm up to Canadian Oil. China’s largest private refiner, Rongsheng Petrochemical (SHE:002493), opened an office in Calgary to facilitate its purchases of heavy barrels from Alberta pumped through the TMX pipeline, immediately buying a June-arrival cargo from Suncor Energy. Saudi Aramco Wants Back Its Indian Share. Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222), the national oil company of Saudi Arabia, is in negotiations with two Indian refiners, state-controlled ONGC and Bharat Petroleum, although the deals could fall through as the Saudis insist on supplying 90% of the refineries.Nigeria Edges Closer to State’s Oil IPO. Nigeria’s state-controlled oil company NNPC is reportedly in the final stages of preparations for a much-anticipated IPO that could value the NOC at more than $300 billion, having turned into a fully commercial entity in 2021 with its government credit lines cut.Vitol Eyes Full Exit from US Shale. Global commodities trader Vitol is reportedly contemplating a sale of its VTX Energy Partners subsidiary in a deal potentially worth more than $3 billion, offering some 46,000 boe/d of production across the Delaware basin located across 46,000 net acres.India Stops Buying Venezuelan Crude. The tightening of US sanctions, with Donald Trump levying a 25% tariff on anyone buying Venezuelan oil, has prompted Indian refiners, most notably privately held Reliance Industries, to halt any imports from the Latin American country beyond April.Gold Hits Record Again Amidst Tariff Frenzy. Gold prices rallied to another all-time this week, reaching $3,077 per ounce on Friday as the Trump administration’s automobile tariffs further sapped investors’ confidence, with US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting a $3,300/oz price by the end of this year.China Chokes Off Product Exports with Low Quotas. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued the 2nd batch of product export quotas for 2025, adding 104 million barrels to this year’s total of 260 million barrels, down 4% from a year ago as higher government levies restricted export economics for refiners.India to Lift Restrictions on US Energy Imports. India’s government is considering lifting all import taxes on LNG imports to help lower Delhi’s $45 billion trade surplus with the United States, as Prime Minister Modi pledged to ramp up US energy purchases from $10 billion to $25 billion.  Tesla Readies for Saudi Expansion. Top US electric vehicle producer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will start sales of its cars in Saudi Arabia in April, 7 years after a funding dispute between Elon Musk and the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, seeking to disrupt the Middle Eastern expansion of China’s BYD and Lucid.Brazil Expands Domestic Refinery Capacity. Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) has finished upgrading works at its Rnest refinery in Pernambuco state, boosting the plant’s capacity to 260,000 b/d and hiking the country’s diesel output by a further 82,000 b/d, needing fewer imports.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.com

Mar 27 2025 3:00 PM ,U.S. Copper Import Tariffs May Arrive Sooner Than Expected,"President Trump's national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, launched in February to review raw copper, refined copper, copper concentrates, copper alloys, scrap copper, and other copper derivatives imported into the U.S, directed the Commerce Department to deliver tariff recommendations to the White House within 270 days. That review process has likely been accelerated, as a new report suggests U.S. copper imports could be enacted in the near-term. Sources told Bloomberg that the Trump administration is moving quickly with its review of copper import tariffs and will likely act well before the 270-day deadline, which was expected between September and November. The new timeline has now shifted to mid-May.


Commenting on the shortened timeline, Goldman's Eoin Dinsmore, Aurelia Waltham, and others provided clients with a critical Q&A addressing physical market flows and pricing across various exchanges:What is the impact on physical market flows?Greater certainty on copper tariffs means COMEX is likely to trade at a higher premium to LME, but there is less time to ship metal to the U.S. Assuming tariffs are implemented in May, we think shipments to the U.S. will likely be fast tracked, with net imports in April potentially jumping 200kt[1] above the standard 60-70kt/month, albeit with upside risk. However, with the possibility of earlier tariff implementation, we now expect U.S. stocks to decline by 30-40kt/month from mid-to-late Q2 onwards. Thus, we avoid a stock glut in the U.S. in Q3 2025, when we expect global copper market tightness to be most pronounced.What is the impact on the LME price?We see stranded stocks at the low-end of our range - a 200kt increase in U.S. stocks, and a possible 60kt loss of refined production from lower U.S. exports of copper concentrates and scrap. But by Q3, when we forecast the bulk of the 2025 annual global deficit will occur, U.S. stocks should have started to normalize. Thus, the expected H2 crunch should be less pronounced, which reduces upside risk to our LME price forecast. We hold to our 3/6/12 Month LME price forecasts of $9,600/t, $10,000/t and $10,700/t, and flag near-term downside risk from the trade policy update on April 2nd.Will COMEX now price the full 25% tariff over the LME?Factoring in uncertainty on the tariff level and high U.S. inventories, we think an implied tariff of 20% should be the cap in the near-term. This has also been a level regularly cited as a good exit point in numerous client meetings.Will Sep-Dec 2025 spreads tighten?We close the trade recommendation to go long Sep-Dec 2025 timespreads. Despite Q3 2025 being the key point for global copper market tightness, the spread will no longer need to rise to a level to halt exports to the U.S. Based on our Q3 ex-US reported inventories forecast, the likely backwardation would be only $0-60/t, close to current levels.The analysts see global copper markets shifting into a deficit in 2Q25.


U.S. copper inventories should begin declining after tariffs are enacted.Analysts expect the COMEX and LME spread to be capped soon. The Bloomberg report sent copper prices on Comex up 3% to a record $5.37 per pound. Meanwhile, the benchmark price on the London Metal Exchange fell 2% to $9,893 per ton, widening the gap between the two contracts to about $1,700 per ton""The news today is this story of Copper tariffs coming sooner than possibly expected... LME/CMX arb at $1750-1800 in July (+$300 to start today) or 18% Tarrff expected,"" Goldman analyst James McGeoch told clients earlier. McGeoch offered some thoughts about today's news and copper trading:The durability of this move is significantly greater than 2024. Balances are tight, there is a fundamental driver and a technical ampifier (that technical is also fundamental in that the U.S. is short metal, fundamentally they want to change that).As price traded back to $10k last night, the CMX premium now well above 15%, as it trades through record highs to 529 (+1.5%), traders (with vested interests) talk about price to $12kRemember that whilst metal is being stacked in the U.S., we had last week the China SRB suggest it was also looking to build stocks of critical minerals: cobalt, copper, nickel, and lithium  link. So Apparent demand (at either end, U.S. and China) is amplifying the effect of real demand (electrification, Chinese fiscal put, German infra plan), and tightening the balances furtherTrading observation in discussion Monday - Positioning has not baked the above in. Regional contract differentiation leaves those with the global view on sideline (also too much idiosyncratic risk they lack edge to play). Point is the big rally lacks a big uptick in spec interest/positioning. The copper fwds have a lot to go, the incentives not in the curve and physical premiums doubled last week (first sign they are being impacted). The work now is dissecting physical location premiums and how the moves in inventory can impact near term demand. As we rally to $10k we may see some producing selling and as such spreads can remain bid.CTA's are as long as I can recall, the GS model suggests close to $18bn (historical max 19.6bn). This is where all the length is. CFTC weekly data showed a fairly meh inc for managed money accts (CME +9 to 22k lots, LME +2 to 63k)And we ask: What happens to global copper production with prices at record highs?Now that tariffs are likely to be imposed sooner, importers will have significantly less time to rush copper shipments into the U.S.By Zerohedge.com

Mar 27 2025 11:00 AM ,Saudi Oil Giant Aramco Eyes Investment in Indian Refineries,"Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil firm and single biggest crude exporter, is in discussions to invest in two planned refineries in India, sources in India told Reuters on Thursday.State-owned Indian refiners plan to build several new crude processing plants to meet soaring fuel and petrochemicals demand in the world’s third-largest crude oil importer.


Saudi Arabia, for its part, looks to lock in future term sales for its crude in the top Asian markets, which are set to continue driving global demand growth in the coming years. India has even surpassed China as the single biggest driver of demand growth.Aramco already has several deals with Chinese refiners and petrochemical producers as the Saudi oil giant has been pursuing deals in recent years to expand its international downstream presence, especially in demand centers such as Asia.Now Saudi Aramco has set its sights on investment in the new Indian refineries expected to be built. The Saudi oil giant is offering to supply crude volumes equivalent to three times its future stake in each project, according to Reuters’ sources.Saudi Aramco is discussing buying a stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL)’s $11 billion new refining and petrochemical complex in south India, and is in separate talks with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) for a proposed refinery in the Gujarat state on India’s west coast, the sources told Reuters.However, Indian refiners are continuously looking for cheaper crude and diversified supply, and the Saudi proposal to supply a large part of the oil for the new refineries may not work.


BPCL’s refinery project is at a more advanced stage and the state-owned refiner has already launched some preliminary work on the project, including land purchase.For years Saudi Aramco has been trying to tap downstream opportunities in India. The oil giant has tried – and failed – to reach a deal with private refiner Reliance Industries.By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com

Mar 27 2025 10:00 AM ,Trump Auto Tariffs Threaten Japanese Carmaker Profits,"As the fallout from Trump’s tariff plans comes into relief, a harsh truth is emerging for the automotive industry: there are lots of losers and not many winners. But foreign automakers, those without US facilities, will be hit especially hard. As Bloomberg notes, from South Korea’s Hyundai to Germany’s Volkswagen, and to a lesser extent America’s own General Motors, many of the world’s most prominent carmakers will soon face higher costs from Trump’s new levies on auto imports and key components. That's because about 46% of all new cars sold in the US are imported.


“There are very few winners,” Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a phone interview. “Consumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.”One notable winner in the tariff chaos is Elon Musk. His Tesla, which has large factories in California and Texas, churns out all the electric vehicles it sells in the US, although as Elon noted late on Wednesday, the company will also not remain unscathed.Ford could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.Others will be less lucky: starting April 2, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions. Not surprisingly, the tariffs give automakers that heavily source parts in the US an edge, and Trump also allowed an exemption: the new levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. That may soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won’t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies. The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it’s a long shot.And while NAFTA, pardon USMCA, nations will do everything in their power to be loopholed out, foreign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles are fresh out of luck. South Korea’s auto giant Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit: although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia, and just yesterday announced a $21 billion US expansion plan, it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data. Hyundai “remains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,” the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US. Unfortunately, according to Trump, it should employ many more, and if the company - which imports almost 60% of the cars it sells in the US - wishes to avoid tariffs, it will have to not only hire more American workers, but build many more US plants. Oh, and this is just the beginning: once the reciprocal tariffs kick in next week, South Korean exporters will find themselves in a world of pain.What about Japan? Let's take a closer look at the country which historically has been the biggest global auto maker, and which produces 1.3 million (and another 0.4 million tolled in Mexico) of the 16 million annual car sales (Toyota 0.6mn, Subaru 0.3mn, Nissan 0.2mn, Mazda 0.2mn, MMC 0.1mn, Honda 0.01mn). For Japan, autos account for >30% of Japan’s exports to the US, which imports about 46% of all autos sold each year.


Based on an average sales price of US$45,000, the value of imports would exceed US$330 billion, and US import tariffs could have a major impact on sales prices and auto demand. All else equal, they would raise about $100 billion in annual tax revenues. But all else will certainly not be equal, especially once exporting nations slide into recession, and their export industries are crippled.In an analysis published three weeks ago (report available to pro subs), Goldman looked at one scenario where Japanese cars are hit with 25% tariffs, along with imports from Mexico and Canada. The results were dire. According to Goldman analyst Kota Yuzawa, the potential impact on Japanese auto companies' operating profit - assuming a tariff of 25% on Japan in line with that imposed on imports from Canada and Mexico - is shown below. In this scenario Goldman assumes that sales volumes decline as a result of price hikes made by each company in order to offset the negative impact of tariffs (volume decline of 8-26% based on a 25% price hike for Canada/Mexico/Japan-made vehicles). In that scenario the profit hit will be anywhere between 6% for Toyota to 59% for Mazda.In terms of exposure, Yuzawa calculates that production volume in US is largest for Subaru (39%), Honda (27%), Toyota (13%), Nissan (13%), Mazda (7%).In another, far more draconian scenario, Japanese automakers are unable or simply refuse to hike prices to offset volume declines. The consequences are catastrophic and result in the following hit to operating profits: Toyota -¥570 bn, Honda -¥350 bn, Nissan -¥130 bn, and Mazda -¥60 bn. The implied impact on Goldman's FY3/26 operating profit forecasts would be as follows: Toyota -11%, Honda -23%, Nissan -66%, and Mazda -34%, with Nissan and Mazda seeing relatively large impacts given their larger export mix from Canada/Mexico.That's just the start: in addition to the direct potential impact on finished vehicle exports described above, parts makers also have supply chains spanning multiple countries. Indeed, Toyota-affiliated companies that announced 3Q (October-December) results on January 31 referred to tariff risks. Denso’s sales from Mexico/Canada operations to the US total about ¥220 bn, while Aisin’s are about ¥60 bn. If a 25% tariff were also imposed on parts, Goldman warns forecasts potential profit declines of ¥55 bn/¥15 bn at Denso/Aisin. Toyota Boshoku did not disclose figures but noted a large potential impact, as much of its seat sewing is conducted in Mexico. Parts makers are working to pass on higher costs to automakers. Denso’s management expressed hope that tariff impact would be mitigated to some extent by the possibility of US corporate tax cuts and a weaker Mexican peso.Ultimately, Goldman's Yuzawa expects price increases to spread across the US auto industry, and after several years of pain, tariffed exports will find some parity with domestic producers: “Automobiles are essential goods, however, and in the longer term we expect demand for them to recover and the negative impact of tariffs on volume to gradually diminish as production of US-made models and procurement of US-made parts increases. In addition, the used car market is also robust. Higher new car prices are likely to lead to higher used car prices, which could also boost vehicle purchasing power through higher residual values. Our economists estimate price elasticity of demand at 1.2-1.5 in the short term and 0.2 in the medium term, and we use the midpoint of 1.35 in our scenario analysis in this report.”The problem is what happens until the equilibrium point is reached over several years, and how painful will the looming Japanese recession be, because make no mistake: Japan is now almost certainly facing a recession: Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute (NRI), expects an 25% increase in U.S. auto tariffs to push down Japan's GDP by at least 0.2%. ""The Trump tariff has the potential to immediately push Japan's economy into deterioration,"" he said.But what is worst of all for Japan is that the so-called virtuous wage-price cycle in which the perenially deflating nation managed to find itself, is now also doomed. That's because the auto industry has been the driver of recent wage hikes according to Reuters, as automakers distribute the huge profits they reaped overseas to their employees. Starting April 2, kiss those profits goodbye... and if Japanese automakers want to avoid plummeting stock prices, or worse, bankruptcy, what they will immediately do is announce that any future wage increases have been put on hold and, just as likely, are about to hit reverse.Not surprisingly, Japan’s government has expressed serious concern over the potential fallout from newly announced US tariffs, warning of risks to both bilateral economic ties and global trade stability.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Thursday that Tokyo is closely monitoring the situation following Trump’s announcement of additional tariffs. Speaking at a press briefing, Hayashi cautioned that the broad-based nature of the U.S. trade measures could have far-reaching consequences.“We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the U.S. government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the U.S., as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system,” he said.If only there was anything Japan could do to retaliate.As forexlive notes, one thing Hayashi didn't mention was that the new tariffs are likely to trim back the prospect of a May rate hike from the Bank of Japan, echoing what we said, namely that ""these new tariffs will hit Japan's auto industry hard, and thus economic data.""By Zerohedge.com

Mar 26 2025 7:00 PM ,Oil Prices Gain On Venezuela Tariffs,"Oil prices rallied in Wednesday’s session, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela will pay a 25% secondary tariff on trades with the United States. Trump claims that Venezuela has sent ""tens of thousands"" of people to the U.S. who have a ""very violent nature."" Brent crude for May delivery gained 1.2% to trade at $73.89 per barrel at 11.30 am ET while the comparable WTI crude contract climbed 1.2% to $69.84.The secondary tariffs will target China, India, Spain, Italy and Cuba–all major buyers of Venezuelan oil. The tariffs could disrupt global oil supply chains, with U.S. oil companies likely to emerge as key beneficiaries of Venezuela’s customers looking for alternative supplies. Earlier this month, Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) received a 30-day notice from the Trump administration to wrap up its operations in Venezuela. The deadline, set for April 3, provides the company only 30 days instead of the normal six-month wind-down period. Since 2022, Chevron has been allowed to operate in Venezuela as an exception to U.S. sanctions, exporting crude to the United States. According to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other foreign-policy hawks, Chevron has been providing a financial lifeline for Maduro’s regime to enrich itself and suppress civil rights. Venezuela produced about 20% of Venezuela’s oil in 2024, close to Maduro’s goal of 1 million barrels per day. Chevron is the only major oil producer with a waiver to operate in Venezuela despite Washington’s sanctions against President Nicolás Maduro’s regime. 


Venezuela's crude oil production has declined sharply from 3.2 million b/d in 2000 to 735,000 b/d in September 2023 mainly due to sanctions and poor maintenance.Global Oil Demand Robust Despite TariffsOil prices have held up surprisingly well over the past couple of weeks despite the presence of numerous headwinds that could have pushed Brent prices more decisively below $70/bbl. Indeed, front-month Brent has exceeded $70/bbl at some point on each of the past eight trading days. Speculative positioning, however, remains skewed to the short side of the market, particularly for gasoline and crude oil. Trader sentiment remains negative largely due to concerns over the potential demand effects of U.S. tariff policies and the potential supply effects of a U.S. switch to policies that are more accommodative of Russian targets. Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, Standard Chartered analysts argue that global oil demand remains strong, averaging 102.77 million barrels per day (mb/d) in January—a 2.19 mb/d year-on-year increase. The bank forecasts demand will surpass 105 mb/d by June and peak at 105.6 mb/d in August, with full-year growth projected at 1.41 mb/d. They also expect demand to outpace supply in Q2 and Q3. While U.S. tariff policy remains a key downside risk, current demand fundamentals appear solid, supporting a more bullish outlook than recent market sentiment suggests.


Standard Chartered sees a few reasons why oil prices haven't collapsed further in recent weeks. These include an oversold market, underpriced geopolitical risk, and a shift in trader sentiment away from excessive bearishness. Additionally, bullish inventory data reports and a weaker-than-expected U.S. shale supply outlook are lending support. By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com

Mar 26 2025 12:30 PM ,Coal Creeps Back as Gas Gets Pricey,"Coal-fired power generation in the United States jumped at the start of the year, but no thanks to President Donald Trump’s push for “beautiful, clean” coal.The coldest winter in six years boosted electricity demand, while the surge in natural gas prices made gas-fired generation more expensive than coal. As a result, U.S. power producers leaned more heavily on coal – where possible – than on natural gas to meet electricity demand.


Amid below-average temperatures, January 2025 saw a 5.5% annual increase in total power generation in the United States, according to EIA data. Electricity generation from coal increased in all parts of the country, except in the West, compared to January 2024. The change in electricity generation from natural gas was more mixed throughout the country. The MidAtlantic and Southeast both saw an increase in natural gas generation, while the Northeast, Central, West, Florida, and Texas all saw a decrease in electricity generation from natural gas compared to January 2024.More coal-fired generation was activated early this year amid soaring electricity demand in the cold snaps. Higher natural gas prices reduced the profit margins of power producers, and they generated more coal-fired power while curbing production from some gas-generating units. The benchmark U.S. natural gas price at Henry Hub more than doubled in one year—from $1.83 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at this time in 2024 to about $4 per MMBtu in March.Related: Glencore Cuts Coal as Market Glut Smothers PricesIn the first quarter of this year, U.S. gas power generation fell through March 22 by 2% from a year earlier, according to data from LSEG cited by Reuters market analyst Gavin Maguire.While natural gas saw a slight decline, coal power generation nationally jumped by 21% in January through March compared to the same period of 2024, the data showed.While the benchmark natural gas prices surged, coal prices have averaged about $76 per ton so far in the first quarter, which is an increase of only 7% compared to the average U.S. coal price for the first quarter of 2024, according to the LSEG estimates.As a result, emissions from the U.S. power sector rose by 9% in the January-February period and hit a level last seen six years ago, per estimates from energy think tank Ember quoted by Reuters’ Maguire.Natural gas prices could ease somewhat going into the so-called shoulder season between April and June, but a rally could follow in the summer months with an expected spike in electricity demand for cooling.


Higher natural gas prices could spur more coal-fired power generation and, naturally, a rise in U.S. power sector emissions.In its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for March, the EIA sees the Henry Hub price averaging around $4.20/MMBtu in 2025, which is 37% higher than the forecast in October.The natural gas price is expected to average even higher in 2026—about $4.50/MMBtu, as global demand for LNG grows and U.S. LNG export facilities ramp up capacities.In this context, coal is likely to enjoy a short-term rebound in U.S. electricity generation as natural gas prices rise, the EIA said in the STEO.Increased overall electricity demand, along with higher natural gas prices, could raise U.S. coal generation by 6% in 2025, while natural gas generation would drop by 3% as a result of higher fuel costs. In 2026, the EIA expects coal generation to fall by 8%, while natural gas generation will stay relatively flat.The EIA expects U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to increase by 2% in 2025 and to decrease by 1% in 2026. Rising coal emissions are linked to an expected growth in coal-fired electricity generation.But CO2 emissions from coal are expected to decrease in 2026 as coal-fired generation is set to drop back to near-2024 levels, the EIA reckons.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com

Mar 26 2025 9:55 AM ,Oil Prices Rise as the EIA Reports a Decline in Crude and Product Inventories,"Crude oil inventories in the United States saw a decrease of 3.3 million barrels during the week ending March 21, according to new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday.Crude oil prices were trading up prior to the crude data release by the U.S. Energy Information Administration after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported on Tuesday a draw of 4.6 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories amid a strong gasoline draw. The Brent benchmark was trading up 0.88% at 9:39 a.m. ET at $73.66—a roughly $3 per barrel increase over this same time last week. The WTI benchmark, meanwhile, was trading up 0.84% at $69.58—just shy of a $3 per barrel rise over last week’s levels.


For total motor gasoline, the EIA estimated that inventories decreased 1.4 million barrels for the week to March 21, with production averaging 9.2 million barrels daily. This compares with an inventory decrease of 500,000 barrels for the previous week and an average daily production of 9.6 million barrels.For middle distillates, the EIA estimated another inventory decrease, this time of 400,000 barrels, with production decreasing to an average of 4.5 million barrels daily. This compares to an inventory dip of 2.8 million barrels in the week prior, when production stood at an average of 4.6 million barrels daily. Distillate inventories are now 7% below the five-year average for this time of year.Total products supplied over the last four weeks were down week over week, averaging 20.2 million barrels per day—a 0.5% increase over this time last year. Distillate products supplied over the last four weeks are up 1.8% compared to this time last year, while gasoline products supplied were down 0.2% from same period last year.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com

Mar 26 2025 3:00 PM ,Palisades Nuclear Plant Revival Sparks Industry Interest,"In recent years, interest in developing the U.S. nuclear power capacity has grown. Under the Biden administration’s push for a green transition, more companies were encouraged to invest in clean energy. In addition, the power demand is expected to grow much more rapidly than previously thought, as the tech sector drives demand with plans to construct huge data centres. This, and efforts to improve the public perception of the safety standards of nuclear facilities, have revitalised support for nuclear power. In addition to plans to build new, large-scale nuclear reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs) in the coming decades, the U.S. hopes to refurbish several of its long-neglected power plants. There were 104 operational nuclear reactors in the U.S. between 1998 and 2013, but this figure declined to 92 by 2022. In 2023, 22 commercial nuclear power reactors at 18 sites were in various stages of decommissioning, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 


Now, with reinvigorated support for nuclear power, several companies are interested in renovating viable nuclear plants, which could be potentially cheaper and faster than developing new projects. Last year, Holtec International, the private owner of the Palisades Power Plant in Covert, Michigan, announced plans to reopen the facility after it closed in 2022 following 40 years of operation. The plant closed two weeks ahead of schedule due to a glitch with a control rod, despite a $6 billion federal programme to save nuclear plants suffering from increasing costs. Holtec said it hoped to get the plant up and running again by the end of 2025. Despite the significant uncertainty surrounding the clean energy industry under the new President Donald Trump administration, nuclear power seems to be one thing that both Biden and Trump agreed on. Trump’s recently-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright has voiced his support for nuclear power. His first Secretarial Order stated, “The long-awaited American nuclear renaissance must launch during President Trump’s administration. As global energy demand continues to grow, America must lead the commercialisation of affordable and abundant nuclear energy.” This month, Wright announced the release of the second loan disbursement of almost $57 million - of an up to $1.52 billion loan guarantee from the Loan Programs Office - to Holtec for the Palisades Nuclear Plant. Its development will be further supported by a $1.3 billion loan from the Department of Agriculture and $300 million in grants from the state of Michigan. Wright stated, “Unleashing American energy dominance will require leveraging all energy sources that are affordable, reliable and secure - including nuclear energy.” He added, “Today’s action is yet another step toward advancing President Trump’s commitment to increase domestic energy production, bolster our security and lower costs for the American people.”The Palisades will be the first U.S. commercial nuclear plant to recommence operations after they were ceased, subject to U.S. NRC licensing approvals. Once complete, it is expected to deliver 800 MW of clean power and support 600 jobs. Holtec now plans to repair the steam generators, at the facility as the standard procedure for maintaining the units was not followed when the plant was closed. If successful, the reopening of the Palisades Nuclear Plant could provide a blueprint for other energy companies to follow. With the demand for power increasing rapidly, the refurbishment of existing nuclear facilities could provide the clean power needed to avoid a transition back to fossil fuels. However, the project is not without its challenges. 


The Palisades first began operations in 1971 and, having been shut for three years requires some work to get it up and running again to the necessary safety standards. Holtec found that there are damaged tubes in the plant’s two generators, which were installed in 1990. The tubes are needed to protect public health as, if a tube ruptures, it is possible for radioactive material to be released. Plant operators must show NRC that if any tube failure occurs, any release of materials would remain below “conservative limits.”Alan Blind, the engineering director at Palisades from 2006 to 2013 under the previous owner Entergy, explained, “The NRC is scared to death of steam generator tube ruptures. It’s a very real accident. It’s not a hypothetical.” Holtec has told the media that the generators are “fully repairable” and has requested that the NRC complete its review of the repair plan by 15th August. However, federal regulators believe it may take longer to reopen the Palisades than Holtec’s current deadline. Holtec’s repair plan is scheduled to commence in the summer following inspection and testing. Both Holtec and the government are optimistic about the reopening of the Palisades. If successful, it could encourage nuclear companies to invest in the refurbishment of other plants. However, should the project be more expensive, complicated, or slower than anticipated, it could deter other companies from undertaking similar projects.  By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com

Mar 26 2025 11:00 AM ,Five Big Questions Following the Riyadh Meetings,"After separate US talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations over three days in Saudi Arabia, the United States announced separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia on barring the use of force in the Black Sea and on efforts to halt strikes on energy facilities in both countries, but plenty of obstacles remain on the path to peace.The pair of White House statements -- one covering the March 23 and 25 talks with Ukraine, the other the March 24 meeting with Russia – came hours after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the content of the US-Russia talks “will definitely not be publicized.""


Both statements said that “the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution” of the war, now in its fourth year since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The agreements appear to be among the most concrete achievements in US President Donald Trump’s efforts to broker an end to the war since he took office two months ago, but they left plenty of things unclear – including how far Moscow may be ready to go toward a full cease-fire or a peace deal that leaves it short of subjugating Ukraine.Here are some key questions.Will A Black Sea Truce Be Implemented?Both the United States and Russia suggested the main goal of this round was to reach agreement on a maritime cease-fire in the Black Sea, which would allow for the free flow of shipping in the strategic body of water and act as a stepping stone to a broader truce.Russia and Ukraine both have Black Sea coastlines and Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which Russia invaded and occupied in 2014, extends southward into it from the mainland. The Black Sea is a major conduit for exports of Ukrainian and Russian grain.Ahead of the US-Russia meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated Russian claims that promises made to Moscow under a 2022 shipping safety agreement known as the Black Sea grain deal, which collapsed the following year when Russia withdrew amid mutual recriminations, had not been fulfilled.On March 25, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov repeated those claims again, suggesting that adversaries are suppressing Russian grain and fertilizer exports. The White House statement on the Russia talks said the United States would “help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”That marked a significant incentive for Russia, but the devil may remain in the details.In its own statement, the Kremlin said the halt on the use of force in the Black Sea would take effect after several specific actions are in place, demanding detailed measures that were not expressly mentioned by the White House. They included the lifting of sanctions against Rosselkhozbank, Russia’s state-owned agricultural lender, and other financial institutions, and their reconnection to the SWIFT payments system, which may be contingent on EU approval.Meanwhile, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who took part in the US-Ukraine talks, called on social media for “additional technical consultations as soon as possible to agree on all the details and technical aspects of the implementation, monitoring and control of the arrangements.""He also said that Ukraine could “exercise [the] right to self-defense"" if Russian warships move westward from the eastern part of the Black Sea.There was no sign of a direct agreement between Ukraine and Russia, potentially increasing the chances of differing interpretations, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized aspects of the US-Russia agreement.""As far as we know, the Russians raised the issue of the American side helping the Russians transport their agricultural…products. That is about ports, tariffs, and so on,” he said. “We did not agree to this…. We believe that this is a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions.""


What About A Pause In Strikes On Energy Facilities?The talks in Riyadh came after Trump’s proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire -- a cessation of hostilities on land, at sea, and in the air -- was accepted by Ukraine on March 11 but ran up against Russian resistance. After Trump spoke separately to Putin and Zelenskyy, Kyiv and Moscow agreed in principle last week to a narrower truce.But White House and Kremlin readouts after the Trump-Putin phone call on March 18 included a small but substantial difference. The US statement said the leaders “agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure cease-fire,” while the Russian statement described a narrower halt to attacks on “energy infrastructure.”The Kremlin said Putin had praised the initiative and “immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding command,” but Ukraine accused Russia of continuing attacks on infrastructure, including energy facilities.In its parallel statements on March 25, the White House statement did not mention infrastructure specifically, saying that the countries had “agreed to develop measures for implementing [agreements] to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.”Who Will Control What?A major question looming over any cease-fire agreement or eventual peace pact is the question of territory: How much of Ukraine, if any, will Russia control and under what circumstances?Speaking to reporters in Washington on March 24, Trump suggested that the negotiations in Riyadh were touching on this.""We're talking about territory right now. We're talking about lines of demarcation,” Trump said.Russia currently occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine: all of Crimea, almost all of the Luhansk region, as well as parts of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions -- but not the capitals of the last two. In September 2022, Putin baselessly declared the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions to belong to Russia in their entirety, including the areas that are under Ukrainian control.Moscow says Ukraine must pull its forces from the regions and insists that they be recognized as Russian. Zelenskyy has acknowledged that Kyiv may be unable to regain control over the whole country soon. Any cease-fire agreed in the near future seems likely to leave much of the occupied territory in Russian hands, but Ukraine vows never to accept any formal or permanent change of its borders.The White House statements on the Riyadh talks made no mention of territory.What About That Rare Minerals Deal?On March 25, Zelenskyy told journalists that the United States has proposed a comprehensive new version of a mineral resources deal that have been under discussion for months. In his comments on March 24, Trump said that Washington and Kyiv would “soon”sign an agreement on joint development of Ukraine’s rare minerals and other natural resources, which US officials say would help provide Ukraine with security and be an important part of a solution to Russia’s war on Ukraine.Signing the deal was expected when Zelenskyy visited the White House on February 28, but that meeting ended in acrimony after Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in an unprecedented exchange before reporters in the Oval Office.Tensions have cooled since then, and an agreement on rare minerals could be a sign of solidarity between Ukraine and the United States as Trump’s efforts to end the war continue.What’s Russia’s Game?Trump said that Putin’s response to the proposal for a full 30-day cease-fire was “we are for it, but there are nuances.""Among other things, those “nuances” included a call for Ukraine’s backers to stop sending weapons and for Kyiv to stop mobilizing soldiers during the truce -- while Russia would not be subject to such restrictions.Kyiv has accused Moscow of playing for time and feigning interest in ending the war. And analysts say Russia may be deliberately dragging out the process in the hopes of moving as close to its goals as it can -- through diplomacy and on the battlefield.“For the moment this process has been entirely cost-free from a Russian perspective. And I think the lesson they're drawing from this is that if they go slowly, first of all they can extract concessions from the Americans, and potentially from the Europeans, just in order to keep Russia at the table,” Sam Greene, a professor at the King's Russia Institute and director of democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said on a podcast on March 20.Greene suggested that regardless of what they can agree upon, there is a gap between the goals of Trump and Putin when it comes to Russia’s war against Ukraine.Trump wants “an end to this war,” he said, while “Russia wants an outcome to this war that leaves it in a position of dominion in Ukraine. I think Russia believes it can afford to be flexible in terms of how that dominion is executed...so long as it is dominant.""By RFE/RL

Mar 26 2025 9:00 AM ,TotalEnergies CEO Not Ruling Out Return of Nord Stream Gas Pipelines,"The mothballed Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Germany may return to service at some point as Europe’s industry would need some Russian gas to stay competitive, TotalEnergies’ chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Wednesday.“I would not be surprised if two out of the four (came) back to stream, not four out of the four,” Patrick Pouyanne said at an industry event in Germany’s capital city, Berlin, as carried by Reuters.


“There is no way to be competitive against Russian gas with LNG coming from wherever it is,” the executive added.Gas leaks in Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea were discovered at the end of September 2022.Nord Stream 2 was never put into operation after Germany axed the certification process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia, for its part, shut down Nord Stream 1 indefinitely in early September of 2022, claiming an inability to repair gas turbines because of the Western sanctions.But speculation has intensified in recent weeks that a revival of the pipelines could be a part of a deal for the end of the war in Ukraine.Earlier this month, Germany’s outgoing economy and energy minister Robert Habeck said that ideas to resurrect the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to Germany are the “wrong direction of discussion”.


“The Ukrainians are still under the aggression of Russia. So I think talking about the potential of Nord Stream 2 or Nord Stream 1, if it's going to be repaired, is completely the wrong direction of discussion,” Habeck said.In response to reports about a resurrection of the pipelines, Germany’s Economy Ministry early this month said that it is neither willing nor planning to discuss a restart to the pipeline.Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna, for his part, said, “The right place for Nord Stream 2 is at the bottom of the sea, in pieces, not on the EU’s energy market.”By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com
